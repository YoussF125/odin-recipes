    <h1>Macarona Bechamel</h1>

    <h1>What is Macarona Bechamel</h1>
    <div>
    <p>Macarona Bechamel is essentially Egypt’s take on a Bechamel pasta bake. Typically, it’s made from layers of penne pasta, a spiced meat and tomato sauce, and bechamel. <br> A cheesy layer is often added but is not necessary. (This recipe adds a mozzarella layer because mmmm…cheese.)
        <br> <br>
        Regarding which method (cheese or no cheese) is most authentic, the jury is out – you’ll get a different answer depending on who you ask!
        <br> <br>
        When I asked my Egyptian foodie friends how they’d describe this comfort food favorite, they called it something in-between a beef lasagna and a Greek pastitsio.</p></div>

            <h1>How to make Macarona Bechamel</h1>
            <p>Making an Egyptian pasta bake, like Macarona Bechamel, is easier than you’d think! The process is actually very similar <br> to making a lasagna – except, you’re using penne pasta instead of lasagna sheets, and a creamy bechamel sauce instead <br> of the traditional 
                tomato-based sauce you see in many lasagnes. Here are the main steps:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Prepare the pasta</h1>
            <p>Nothing special here! You’re just preparing the pasta as you always would (al dente, you are cooking your pasta al dente, right bestie?).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Make the Béchamel mixture</h1>
            <p>Luckily, Bechamel is one of the easiest mother sauces to prepare. It’s simply a matter of mixing melted butter with flour and milk over a low heat.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Macarona Bechamel, Assemble!</h1>
            <p>In a large baking dish, Add the components you’ve already made: pasta first, then stir in the meat sauce. Next is a layer of mozzarella cheese, <br> and the finally layer is a generous helping of the creamy bechamel sauce you’ve made. Smooth it out, bake, and then you’re ready for an Egyptian feast!</p>
